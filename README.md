## ⚖️ Disclaimer
- **Respect RA Policies:** Do not post ROM links on RetroAchievements’ website or Discord.
- **ROM Legality:** Only access ROMs you legally own. Downloading ROMs without owning a physical copy may violate copyright laws.
- **Game Preservation:** This tool supports video game preservation, but always respect developers’ and publishers’ rights.
- **No File Hosting:** The script does not host ROMs; it only links to them, similar to a search engine.
- By using this script, you agree to comply with all relevant laws.

## ⚠️ Technical Notes
- **Myrient Links:** Due to Myrient changes, download requests open the website and search for the filename before downloading.
- **Archive.org Links:** Some files rely on Archive.org. Stay signed in to access them.
- **Rezi Search Links:** For games with unmatched hashes, the script provides a Rezi search link so you can quickly attempt to manually locate the correct ROM.
- **Game ID Changes:** RetroAchievements occasionally recycles game IDs. Report any issues here or submit a pull request to update [`hashlinks.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mentalblank/RARomOnHashes/refs/heads/main/hashlinks.json).
- **Update Cycle:** The script checks for updates once every 24 hours if the repository has changed.
- **Manifest V3:** Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera) may face userscript compatibility issues. You may need [developer mode enabled](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq#Q209). Firefox is recommended for best results.
